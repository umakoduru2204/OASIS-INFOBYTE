## Landing Page

This project focuses on building a professional landing page using HTML and CSS. By working on this project, you will enhance your understanding of foundational HTML and CSS concepts. Key tasks include adding columns, dividing sections, arranging items, incorporating headers and footers, and using your creativity to create an impressive design. Pay attention to alignments, padding, color palette, and ensure that CSS is utilized effectively to prevent element overlap.

Include a diverse range of samples and skills in your portfolio, and don't forget to add your resume. The portfolio should feature an image at the top for self-introduction, followed by contact information. This project will help you demonstrate your capabilities and create a strong online presence.

## Temperature Converter Website

This project involves building a temperature converter website where users can input a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius and press a "convert" button. The converted temperature will be displayed with the correct unit. The user interface should include:

1. Input field for users to type in their temperature (validate input as a number).
2. Dropdown menu or radio button for users to choose Celsius or Fahrenheit.
3. "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion.
4. Display area for the final converted temperature and unit.

For an extra challenge, consider adding a third conversion option to convert from and to Kelvin. This project will reinforce your understanding of handling user input, implementing conversion logic, and creating an interactive web interface.
